# About cognitive load theory

## Intro

As a teacher, I'm always looking for techniques that help my students learn most effectively. My colleagues and I have been trying several "progressive" teaching techniques, like "flipping the classroom", "problem based learning", etc. with varying degrees of success. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, and I don't understand why. Unfortunately, there's a lot of BS going around about education and learning, and it's hard to find the gems between al the crap...

Recently, I started following [Pedro De Bruyckere](https://twitter.com/thebandb), a teacher that became an educational scientist because his "BS detector went too far into the red" (Gent M, 2017).

Through him, I ran into some other resources, a.o. a blog post about *Cognitive Load Theory* (Ashman, 2017) and an overview of introductory materials on the subject (Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, 2017; Sweller, 2017).

## Cognitive load theory

It is generally accepted that the brain consists of two parts:

- The *working memory*: used to process new information. The working memory is limited in capacity and time. You can only think about a few objects at a time, and it can only store data for a short period of time.
- The *long term memory*: where information can be stored indefinitely. The long term memory has near infinite storage capacity. The working memory can store/retrieve information into/from the long term memory in the form of *schemas*.

Schemas organise elements of information according to how they will be used. Higher level schemas can combine information from several lower level schemas, and there's basically no bound to their complexity (Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, 2017).

The basic premise of Cognitive Load Theory is that **if the working memory is overloaded, no learning can take place**. So the most important job of a teacher is to manage student's cognitive load, i.e. ensure that the working memory can perform optimally to facilitate schema construction so new information can be stored into long term memory. Schemas play an important role here, since they can be held into working memory as a single unit.

## Types of cognitive load

- Intrinsic load: The inherent complexity of the material and the prior knowledge of the learner
- Extraneous load: Poorly designed instruction that does not facilitate schema construction and automation
- Germane load: Well designed instruction that directly facilitates schema construction and automation

## Cognitive load effects

There are more effects than enumerated here...

- *Worked example effect:* students perform better when the teacher provides a solved problem with every step fully explained.
- *Expertise reversal effect:* at a certain point, worked examples become redundant and may even become counter-productive.
- *Problem completion effect:* a worked example should be followed by a similar but unresolved problem to maximise motivation.
- *Redundancy effect:* overloading the working memory with information that is redundant or unnecessary for learning prevents learning. (e.g. reading text from presentation slides verbatim).
- *Split attention effect:* occurs when learners need to process 2 or more sources of information simultaneously in order to understand the material (e.g. figure with caption).
- *Modality effect:* we have two "channels" through which we can process new information: visual and auditory. We can use both simultaneously (increasing working memory capacity), provided that the information is complementary, not redundant.
- *Goal free effect:* when providing students with a specific problem, they will focus on solving that particular problem and pay no attention to other desirable learning outcomes (e.g. using this problem solving method in other circumstances). I've been bitten by this one quite often!
- *Guidance fading effect:* as expertise is obtained, learners should be less guided in their exercises. This probably explains why problem based learning does work in one of my specialty courses in the final year of our bachelor programme.

## Learning techniques that are proven to work

I'm not going to explain these in detail, that's maybe for another day... Benney (2017) compiled a good overview of good techniques.

- Explicit teaching, direct instruction
- Worked examples
- Spaced repetition
- Retrieval practice
