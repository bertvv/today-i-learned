# A few cool Bash shortcuts

Bash continues to amaze me with useful keyboard shortcuts. Today, thanks to [@climagic](https://twitter.com/climagic), I learned about:

- `Meta-*` Insert all the possible command line completions into the command line you are editing.
- `Ctrl-o` Operate and get next line. This executes the current line from your history and on return gives you the next history line.

Yes, I know, there's lists of all Bash shortcuts out there, and I should learn them all. Someday. Baby steps...
