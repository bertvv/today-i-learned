# Viewing website certificate information in Chrome 56

Date: 2017-03-09

Starting with Chrome 56, the certificate information is no longer accessible from the URL bar, very annoying.

The new way is:

1. Three dots menu > More Tools > Developer Tools
2. Select Security Tab
3. Click "View Certificate" button
